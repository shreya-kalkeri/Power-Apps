I used "Power Apps" from Office 360 Apps for this project.  
  
You can find the app below

Learning and Challenges:  
1. Make excel cells into table by Selecting the entire column --> Insert --> Table --> OK  
2. While I was trying to add file from Excel Source, I got an error as "the file you tried to open isn't a power apps file. to open an app, choose an .msapp file."  
    To solve this, you need to first save the (excel)file on Cloud and login into your cloud platforms(e.g. Onedrive) in Power Apps as well so that you can load the  
    file easily.  
3.Do not keep the file open while loading the file into Power Apps, as it locks the file from being accessed resulting in incomplete data loading.  

Why SharePoint List is a better source than Excel file?  
1. Excel has limitations over rows.  
2. There is no file locking when someone is accessing the file.  
3. Can look up for user names.  
4. Data Types are uploaded along the data load.  
5. Choices and dropdown options are automatically filled.
